    <div class="introduction">
        <p>A project that aims to represent the conditions of children in war zones, <br>
            1945 to today, through the lens of media. <br>
            Pictures, videos, newspaper articles : <br>
            after WWII, there hasn't been a year without an armed conflict around the world. <br>
            War has never ended. <br>
            And neither has the suffering of children.

        Taken outside the village of Trang Bang on June 8, 1972. <br>
        the picture captured the trauma and indiscriminate violence <br>
        a conflict that claimed, by some estimates, a million or more civilian lives. <br>
        Officially titled “The Terror of War,” the photo is better known by the nickname given <br>
        to the badly burned, naked 9-year-old at its center: “Napalm Girl”. <br>
