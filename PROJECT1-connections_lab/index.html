        <p>A project that aims to represent the conditions of children in war zones, <br>
            1945 to today, through the lens of media. <br>
            Pictures, videos, newspaper articles : <br>
            after WWII, there hasn't been a year without an armed conflict around the world. <br>
            War has never ended. <br>
            And neither has the suffering of children.
