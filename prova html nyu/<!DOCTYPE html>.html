    <h1>A game kids shouldn't play </h1>
    <h2>Low Res / Summer 2025 - Final Project</h2>
    <p>After finding a recording of my grandfather’s experience during WWII, 
        I decided to create an interactive art piece.</p>
        <p>The goal is to tell his story as a living testimony of that time 
            and reflect on the conditions of children in war zones.</p>

       <h3>Shape sorting kid’s game</h3>
       <p> When you place a shape in the correct slot, you hear a different part of the recording. </p> 
       <i>a game where each shape is linked to a detail from my grandfather’s experience.</i>
